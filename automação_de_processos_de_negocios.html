            <h2 class="sub_titulo">Overview</h2>
            <p class="paragrafo">
                Business Process Automation (BPA) is the use of software to automate reproducible and multi-step
                business transactions.
                Compared to other types of automation, BPA solutions are often complex, connected to various enterprise
                IT systems, and
                customized specifically to the needs of organizations.<br>
                It is common for organizations to apply BPA in a digital transformation strategy to optimize workflows
                and increase
                operational efficiency.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub_titulo2">What is the relationship between BPA and Business Process Management (BPM)?</h2>
            <p class="paragrafo2">
                Business Process Management (BPM) is the collaboration between IT and business teams to model, analyze,
                and optimize
                complete processes to help achieve strategic objectives. BPM is an ongoing process and brings
                improvements over time.<br>
                While BPM is a practice that considers the organization as a whole, BPA is a strategy to enhance
                specific processes.<br>
                BPM aims to eliminate ad-hoc workflow management practices and optimize business operations to deliver
                better services
                and solutions to customers.<br>
                BPA can be used independently or as part of a comprehensive BPM initiative.<br>
                Both enhance processes and tasks that are reproducible, continuous, or predictable. They increase
                efficiency and reduce
                costs and errors.<br>
                The combination of BPA and BPM can be powerful because BPM provides a detailed view of the architecture
                of all business
                processes to be mapped and automated. When applied in a BPM practice, BPA can be used to continuously
                monitor and improve
                process efficiency.<br>
                However, they can also work well separately. Decoupled from an integrated business automation solution,
                BPM and BPA
                function as independent initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce costs.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub_titulo3">What is the relationship between BPA and Robotic Process Automation (RPA)?</h2>
            <p class="paragrafo3">
                In Robotic Process Automation (RPA), you use software to automate specific repetitive tasks. This
                software is trained
                to simulate repetitive human steps, such as copying and pasting data into a field.<br>
                BPA software often handles more complex tasks than RPA. BPA describes automated transaction steps at
                various stages
                that involve a series of business systems.<br>
                Many RPA solutions are pre-built, easy-to-install software tools. They run on existing systems without
                connecting to
                databases or accessing application programming interfaces (APIs).<br>
                BPA solutions are complex and customized according to the specific organization. They are usually
                integrated with data
                systems or connected to APIs. It is possible to incorporate certain RPA software into a BPA
                solution.<br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub_titulo4">What is the best type of software for business process automation?</h2>
            <p class="paragrafo4">
                Companies always want to streamline operations and save costs. Therefore, they often turn to business
                process automation
                software to enhance specific areas. This includes input detection, decision augmentation and automation,
                and the use of
                automated responses.<br>
                The architecture of business automation software makes all the difference. It is recommended that these
                tools can run on
                different types of infrastructure, such as the edge where business decisions are made and scalable cloud
                environments
                according to demand. An increasingly used strategy is to separate the user interface from the workflows
                themselves,
                which are created as services called by APIs.<br>
                The solution includes various lightweight services that can be deployed in containers, such as Red Hat
                OpenShift, and
                embedded in custom solutions. These features provide scale and flexibility, making the solution the
                perfect choice for
                larger companies that need to automate many business decisions.<br>
                Red Hat Process Automation Manager includes business rules, complex event processing, business
                optimization, and process
                management tools, along with a user experience platform.<br>
