            <h2 class="sub_titulo">What is home automation?</h2>
            <p class="primeiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo">
                Home automation refers to a set of technologies with the ability to program events in a house and make the operation of various
                devices automatic.
            </p>
            <p class="segundo_paragrafo_sub_titulo">
                Through integrated systems and internet connectivity, home automation aims to create a smart home. One of the most important
                technologies in this process is the Internet of Things (IoT), which is already impacting the daily lives of many households.
            </p>
            <p class="terceiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo">
                The goal is to offer convenience and more practicality to residents through remote control and management of the residence. This
                is done through a simple internet-connected mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet.
            </p>
            <p class="quarto_paragrafo_sub_titulo">
                Thus, you can control home appliances from anywhere you are. Moreover, it is possible to program sensors, locks, and lights, for
                example, so that a specific command is executed automatically.
            </p>
            <p class="quinto_paragrafo_sub_titulo">
                In addition to making life easier for residents, you can create a fully customized home according to your lifestyle, needs, and
                habits.
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub_titulo2">How does this technology work?</h2>
            <p class="primeiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo2">
                To create home automation, you only need devices with electrical connectivity, internet, and an intelligent device that will
                collect and exchange information to make automation possible.
            </p>
            <p class="segundo_paragrafo_sub_titulo2">

            </p>
            <p class="terceiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo2">
                To make an entire house smart, this process is extended to various devices. Through an integration system, all equipment is
                connected to a central controller linked to the internet.
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub_titulo3">What are the advantages of investing in automation?</h2>
