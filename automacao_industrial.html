            Industrial automation is a reality that accompanies technological advances, aiming to optimize production processes, simplify
            routine tasks, and promote the safety of industry professionals.<br>
    
            The number of Brazilian companies investing in digitization has grown in recent years, with the adoption of systems such as data
            analysis, management software, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) among the main transformations.<br>
    
            These insights come from the Survey on Digital Transformation of Companies, conducted by the Brazilian Agency for Industrial
            Development (ABDI) in partnership with the Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation (FGV).<br>
    
            Understand the concept, the main objectives, and benefits of automation, as well as an overview of the current market scenario.

        <h2 class="sub_titulo">What is industrial automation?</h2>
        <p class="paragrafo2">
            Industrial automation is a concept that refers to the optimization of industrial processes through technology. This can include
            the use of software, automated machines, and hardware, for example.<br>
    
            This automation encompasses the mechanical, electronic, and information technology (IT) areas, responsible for developing
            operational systems and solutions capable of replacing or optimizing manual activities.<br>
    
            Some examples of automated systems present in everyday life are the automatic opening and closing of doors in malls and
            supermarkets or the announcement of stops and stations on the subway route.<br>
    
            Today, technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things have gained prominence in this context.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub_titulo">The evolution of automation</h2>
        <p class="paragrafo2">
            The automation process began before the emergence of these technologies. According to an article published by the Federal
            University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), this history began with the replacement of manual control by machines in equipment
            production.<br>
    
            This happened during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. At that time, the goal was to replace labor in repetitive
            tasks and increase the productivity of industries.<br>
    
            Over time, more primitive technology evolved into automatic controls, and instruments, once analog, began to use intelligent
            systems that process information through digital techniques.<br>
    
            The impact of industrial automation became more visible with the development of computers after the 1960s, according to the
            article.<br>
    
            This advancement allowed the creation of a computer network to unite data from different sectors of the company.<br>
    
            Currently, communication through the Internet of Things can be observed, allowing interoperability, real-time data capture, and
            remote process monitoring, for example.<br>
    
            In an interview with CNN, Pablo Fava, CEO of Siemens, assessed the process of digital transformation in Brazil and highlighted
            the potential of 5G in this scenario.<br>
    
            "A huge potential to transform industries and critical infrastructures that improve people's lives and in which you reconfigure
            industrial operations," he said.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub_titulo">Automation in Brazil</h2>
        <p class="paragrafo3">
            It was in the year 2000 that Brazil first appeared in international statistics on installed robots, thus gaining space in the
            field of automation.<br>
    
            This is indicated by an article released by the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, which also highlights the automotive
            sector as a standout in the implementation of automated technologies.<br>
    
            According to the Survey on Digital Transformation of Companies presented earlier, more than 24% of the organizations interviewed
            confirmed an increase in investments related to the digitization of processes in the second quarter of 2023.<br>
    
            Among the sectors evaluated, the industry appears as the largest investor in digital transformation.<br>
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub_titulo">The industrial automation market</h2>
        <p class="paragrafo4">
            The automation market continues to evolve, and the expectation is that the sector's valuation will surpass $350 billion by 2024,
            according to data from Transparency Market Research, released by the Brazilian Textile and Clothing Industry Association (Abit).<br>
    
            Some factors that may drive this growth include the demand for personalized products, the need to reduce energy consumption and
            greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the global economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic.<br>
    
            A survey conducted in 2021, for example, showed the benefits of automation in a crisis scenario.<br>
    
            According to data collected by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI), organizations with Industry 4.0 technology profited
            more during the period, in addition to being able to maintain the workforce or even hire new professionals.<br>
    
            Additionally, the development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing can
            also contribute to the creation of new automation solutions in the industrial sector.<br>
    
            In this context, the market is likely to present new needs, both related to consumers and industrial professionals.<br>
