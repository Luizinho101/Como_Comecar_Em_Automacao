                    Have you noticed that automation is at the center of technology conversations? The topic is
                    increasingly
                    popular.
                    Whether at international events or in prestigious reports, professionals in the field are becoming
                    aware
                    increasingly about the importance of automating and giving intelligence to processes to have more
                    security and
                    efficiency in decision making.
                </p>
                <p class="segundo_paragrafo">
                    It turns out that it is often not very easy to understand the first steps on the journey towards a
                    successful project.
                    in the area of ​​automation. There are many doubts. But we guarantee: the important thing is to
                    start.
                    Even because a project
                    automation never ends.
                </p>
                <p class="terceiro_paragrafo">
                    Like this? Does that mean you'll be redoing that same project forever? Yes and no. Automation within
                    of technology is like a vital sign, and like any vital sign, it needs support to be maintained.
                    After
                    To begin with, maintaining work is essential to success.
                </p>
                <h2 class="sub_titulo">Automation is a continuous process</h2>
                <p class="primeiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo">
                    Automation is the act of automating a process and giving intelligence to the system so that it can
                    make
                    decisions on its own based on
                    of that event. This can range from a simple project to more complex ones.
                </p>
                <p class="segundo_paragrafo_sub_titulo">
                    To be clearer: automation works based on an automated process, but with some intelligence in the
                    his decision making. This could be, for example, extracting a list of names from the customer
                    register
                    on a daily basis and
                    put in a repository. This is automatic. Seeing and highlighting customers with specific names or
                    ages is
                    automation of this process.
                </p>
                <p class="terceiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo">
                    Ok. But let's say you want to insert automation into your processes now. What are the first steps
                    What everyone should know when starting out?
                </p>
                <h2 class="sub_titulo2">STEP 1: MAP THE PROCESSES.</h2>
                <p class="primeiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo2">
                    First of all: for any automation, you need to have a very clear flow. It seems simple, but the best
                    The thing to do is document every step of your work. This can be done in several ways, but ideally
                    is to have most of the details described. Note carefully: the majority. We know that it is
                    impossible to
                    document all
                    stages of any process.
                </p>
                <p class="segundo_paragrafo_sub_titulo2">
                    So you might as well start small. And this also needs records. Define where the first project
                    begins and how far it goes. This is part of our second tip.
                </p>
                <h2 class="sub_titulo3">STEP 2: SET STANDARDS AND SCHEDULES</h2>
                <p class="primeiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo3">
                    Anything that is repetitive is easier to automate. And everything that is automated will be the
                    first
                    step towards automation. After mapping the processes, it will be easy to understand everything that
                    is
                    repeated. Very
                    or little, it doesn't matter.
                </p>
                <p class="segundo_paragrafo_sub_titulo3">
                    Standards. This part is very important.
                </p>
                <p class="terceiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo3">
                    Identify patterns in work and set timelines for implementing steps. Automation is a cycle.
                    You will eventually need to go back to the first steps to make corrections and add intelligence,
                    this
                    It's part of your system training.
                </p>
                <p class="quarto_paragrafo_sub_titulo3">
                    That's why it's important to have standards and processes well mapped out. And monitored. Which
                    brings
                    us to the third step.
                </p>
                <h2 class="sub_titulo4">STEP 3: MONITOR</h2>
                <p class="primeiro_paragrafo_sub_titulo4">
                    Qualquer projeto de automação precisa ser monitorado. Um erro muito comum é o de acreditar que
                    adicionar
                    automação
                    a um processo é um ato pontual, quando na verdade é um trabalho contínuo de monitoramento e
                    melhorias.
                </p>
                <p class="segundo_paragrafo_sub_titulo4">
                    Automation will make decisions and bring results to you. It is important that this action is
                    monitored
                    to constantly improve the functioning of your system.
                </p>
                <p class="primeiro_paragrafo_geral">
                    In fact, a good strategy is to define from the beginning how your processes will be monitored. The
                    risk
                    of errors will be much smaller. And even if errors happen, they will be documented and visible,
                    which
                    will make it easier
                    a lot to teach the system and have a more refined automation process.
                </p>
                <p class="segundo_paragrafo_geral">
                    Remember the list of names? In the beginning, the automation process may result in changed names, or
                    end
                    up selecting
                    homonyms you didn't ask for. By monitoring these results, you will be able to adjust your project
                    for
                    better results.
                    best.

                <p class="terceiro_paragrafo_geral">
                    Finally, always write everything down. You can't improve something that isn't measured.
